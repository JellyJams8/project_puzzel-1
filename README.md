# Outline:
The goal of this project is to have a smaller scoped objective in order further learn game developement using unity as well as get closer to some kind of playable prototype for a larger rpg-like video game.

The sections below will likely change throughout development and will mostly serve as a guidline to keep development moving forward as well as provide a central notepad for possible features or anything that might help future development.

## Phase 1 Features&Goals
### Currently in Development
- top-down view based on square tiles
- visual/audio undecided - use placeholder assets all around.
- player characters with basic stats. they don't even have to do anything just yet, but being view-able in some way like the unity inspector would be nice:
  - HP
  - MP
  - Speed (or whatever stat for ATB meter stuff)
  - Strength (evneually will be melee weapon strength)
  - Dexterity (eventually will be ranged weapon strength)
  - Intelligence (eventually will be magic strength)
- player party of variable size with a set-able max number of party members
- grid/tile based map with non-grid based movement
- enemies with same setable stats as party members
- random number of enemies spawn for the player to fight
- player and enemies have an "attack" action
- win condition: Player defeats all enemies and gains xp
- lose condition: Player party defeated and game over

## Phase 2 Features&Goals
### After phase 1, one or more of the following could be the next development focus.
- game saving and loading system.
  - should be able to set stats, save it, and load a saved file.
- create basic GUI for displaying stats
- create some kind of AOE attack or magic
- investigate and implement verticality in the evironment in some fasion, possiblly faked vertical elements were its all just based off a stat and the art only makes it look higher up.
